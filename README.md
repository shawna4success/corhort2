**Black History Month - Philip Emeagwali**
The web owes much of its existence to Philip Emeagwali, a math whiz who came up with the formula for allowing a large number of computers to communicate at once.

A **website** is a collection of webpages under a single URL (Uniform Resource Locator). Youtube (youtube.com) is a website.
A **web host** is the computer which holds the web server and database.
A **web application** is a website which offers advanced functionality like a computer program would. An example of a web application would be a web based calendar, or web based email. Youtube.com is also a web application

### IP Address

## HTML

_What Are HTML & CSS?_
HTML, HyperText Markup Language, gives content structure and meaning by defining that content as, for example, headings, paragraphs, or images. CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a presentation language created to style the appearance of content—using, for example, fonts or colors.
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. Developed by scientist Tim Berners-Lee in 1990, HTML is the "hidden" code that helps us communicate with others on the World Wide Web (WWW).
HTML elements are represented by tags; HTML tags label pieces of content such as `"head", "body", "p"` and so on.

- [w3schools.com/tags](w3schools.com/tags)
- [developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML](developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML)

### HTML Template

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">
  <title>HTML Template</title>
</head>
<body>
  <!-- HTML Element Tags -->
</body>
</html>
```

#### HTML data-\* Attribute

**Definition and Usage:** The data-\* attribute is used to store custom data private to the page or application.
[https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_data-.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_data-.asp)
Attributes provide additional information about HTML elements.
[https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_attributes.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_attributes.asp)

## CSS

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and it represents the design conventions that are applied to the display of HTML elements on screen, paper and other media.
CSS syntax is expressed in the form of a rule-set consisting of a selector and a declaration box. Colors are specified using pre-defined color names. CSS can be added to HTML elements in three ways: inline, internal and external.

### Sample Code

```
body {
    background-color: powderblue;
}
h1 {
    color: white;
    text-align: center;
}
p {
    font-family: Verdana;
    font-size: 20px;
}
```

#### The CSS Box Model

All HTML elements can be considered as boxes. In CSS, the term `"box model"` is used when talking about design and layout.[https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_boxmodel.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_boxmodel.asp)

#### Data Attributes and CSS

A Complete Guide to Data Attributes | CSS-Tricks
Everything you ever wanted to know about data attributes in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. [https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-data-attributes/](https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-data-attributes/)
In the CSS, a class selector is a name preceded by a full stop `(".")` and an ID selector is a name preceded by a hash character `("#")`. The difference between an ID and a class is that an ID can be used to identify one element, whereas a class can be used to identify more than one.
[https://css-tricks.com/the-difference-between-id-and-class/](https://css-tricks.com/the-difference-between-id-and-class/)

#### CSS Units

CSS has several different units for expressing a length.
Many CSS properties take "length" values, such as width, margin, padding, font-size, etc.
Length is a number followed by a length unit, such as `10px, 2em, etc`.
